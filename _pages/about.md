I am a roboticst discovering the best way for robots to operate when some of their system has failed. My long-term research goal is to allow robots to operate indepently for autonomy timelines of months to years. My work is centered around enabling new manipultion abilities, adapting motion planning approaches, and then tailor their task specific actions to allow robots recover from or operate with faults. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering in May 2021 and am currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at the **University of Colorado - Boulder** in the [HIRO Group](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/).
