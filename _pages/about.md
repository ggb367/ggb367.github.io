I am a computer scientist and engineer focused in robotics. My long-term research goal is to enable robots to flexibly, robustly, and creatively recover from failures in harsh dynamic environments. These robots must percieve their abilities, analyze their systems, and then tailor their actions to recover from their faults. To be effective, they must continuously improve the performance of their self-analysis and explicitly understand the results of their actions. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering in May 2021 and am currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at the **University of Colorado - Boulder** in the [HIRO Group](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/).
