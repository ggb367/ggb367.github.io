I am a roboticist developing autonomous systems that are capable of conducting manipulation tasks independently and collaboratively, with people and with other robots. My PhD research goal is to allow robots to operate independently for autonomy timelines of months to years. My work is centered around enabling new manipulation abilities, adapting motion planning approaches, and then tailor their task specific actions to allow robots recover from or operate with faults. My long-term goal is to develop an autonomous system capable of handling multiple, distinct manipulation tasks. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering in May 2021 and am currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at the **University of Colorado - Boulder** in the [HIRO Group](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/).
