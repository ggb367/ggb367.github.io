I am a roboticist from Houston, Texas. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering in May 2021. I am currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at the University of Colorado - Boulder in the [HIRO Group](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/).
