I am a roboticist who is developing approaches that enable robots to operate independently. To create this, my PhD research goal is to develop robots capable of working after some or many of their components break. My work is centered around merging new manipulation abilities with adaptive motion planning approaches which tailor task-specific actions for robots before and after failure. My long-term goal is to develop autonomous system that are robust in software and repairable and adaptable in hardware. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering in May 2021 and am currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at the **University of Colorado - Boulder** in the [HIRO Group](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/).
