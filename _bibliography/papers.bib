  RoboCup@Home is an international robotics competition based on domestic
  tasks requiring autonomous capabilities pertaining to a large variety of AI
  technologies. Research challenges are motivated by these tasks both at the
  level of individual technologies and the integration of subsystems into a
  fully functional, robustly autonomous system. We describe the progress made
  by the UT Austin Villa 2019 RoboCup@Home team which represents a significant
  step forward in AI-based HRI due to the breadth of tasks accomplished within
  a unified system. Presented are the competition tasks, component
  technologies they rely on, our initial approaches both to the components and
  their integration, and directions for future research.
