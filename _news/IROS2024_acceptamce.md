I am excited to share that our paper, **"Exploring How Non-Prehensile Manipulation Expands Capability in Robots Experiencing Multi-Joint Failure"**, has been accepted for presentation at **IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024**!

## **Paper Summary**
In this work, we explore how **non-prehensile manipulation (NPM) and whole-body interaction** can enable robotic manipulators to **retain functionality despite experiencing locked multi-joint (LMJ) failures**. LMJ failures—where two or more joints become inoperable—severely restrict a robot’s motion and task execution capabilities. Our approach introduces:

1. **Failure-Constrained Workspace Modeling** – Defining the reachability and action space of a failed manipulator.  
2. **Kinodynamic Mapping of Non-Prehensile Actions** – Precomputing viable NPM actions such as pushing and poking to maintain task success.  
3. **A Simulation-Driven Manipulation Planner** – Leveraging a **sim-in-the-loop approach** to select the best non-prehensile actions dynamically.  

Our **experimental evaluation** demonstrates that this method can expand a robot’s failure-constrained workspace by **up to 79%**, and **increase task success rates to 88.9% even when the end-effector is unusable**.

## **Impact & Future Directions**
This research is a step toward making **fault-tolerant robotic manipulation a reality**, particularly in high-stakes applications such as **space robotics, remote surgery, and industrial automation**. By shifting manipulation paradigms beyond traditional grasping, we open new possibilities for **robots to autonomously adapt to unexpected failures**.

We look forward to presenting this work at **IROS 2024** and engaging with the robotics community on the future of **failure-resilient manipulation systems**. If you're attending the conference, come check out our talk!
